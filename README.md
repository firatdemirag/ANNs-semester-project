# ANNs Semester Project

This repository contains the code for a semester project on churn prediction using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The aim of this project is to build an ANNs model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn (i.e., stop using a product or service).

### Data
The dataset used in this project is the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). The dataset contains information about customers of a telecom company and whether they have churned or not. The features include demographic information, services used, and monthly charges.

### How to Use
To use this project, simply clone this repository and run the `churn_prediction.ipynb` notebook. The notebook contains all the code required to train the model and make predictions on new data. You can also modify the code to experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters.
